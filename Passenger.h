 *  Purpose: This is the interface for the Passenger struct. It contains
 *           three variables: ID, departure station, and arrival station.
 *           It also contains a default constructor, a constructor that
 *           takes in a given ID and departure/arrival stations as arguments,
 *           and a print function.
